# Connect Four - CS5100 Capstone Project

This project uses two main algorithms: Minimax and Monte-Carlo Tree Search. 

## Minimax 
For minimax, a depth-limited search was implemented (to introduce a variable computer difficulty and to greatly reduce "thinking" time). 
Expectimax was also implemented to have an algorithm that plays well against suboptimal players. 
Alpha-beta pruning was also used in the algorithms to further reduce thinking time. 

## MCTS
